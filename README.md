## Project Overview

Jira\_App is a two-tiered application enabling users to view, create, and update Jira issues through a custom interface. Itâ€™s designed as an educational or starter project for learning full-stack development with integration to Atlassianâ€™s Jira.

---

## Architecture

* **Backend**: Node.js with Express (located in `backend/`)
* **Frontend**: React (located in `frontend/`)
* **Communication**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to your backend, which communicates with Jiraâ€™s REST API

---

## Features

* List Jira issues from a project
* Create new Jira tickets through the app
* Update issue status and details
* (Optional) Issue filtering or searching

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+) and npm
* A Jira account and project with an API token
* (Optional) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

---

## Installation

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Configure your `.env` (see below), then:

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Edit API endpoint if needed in `.env` or config files, then:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Running the App

Launch both parts:

| Component | Command     | Default Port            |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Backend   | `npm start` | `http://localhost:5000` |
| Frontend  | `npm start` | `http://localhost:3000` |

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the app. The frontend proxies API calls to your backend, which interfaces with Jira.

---

## Configuration & Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with these entries:

```env
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-jira-account-email
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_generated_api_token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=PROJECTKEY
PORT=5000
```

---

## Deployment

1. **Backend**: Deploy to Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or similar (ensure env vars are configured).
2. **Frontend**: Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or static hosting. Adjust API URLs to point to the deployed backend.
3. Update `.env` and restart your services.

### ðŸ’¡ Tips for Young Developers

* Protect sensitive dataâ€”never commit `.env` files!
* Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
* Practice safe Jira tokens through vaults or secret managers.
* Document your API endpoints (e.g., Swagger, Postman collections).
* Write unit tests for backend logic to ensure code quality.
